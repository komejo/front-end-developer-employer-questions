Front End Developer Employer Questions
=======================================

The Front-end Job Interview Questions list (https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) is pretty awesome--if you're an employer. It gave me the idea to have a list of questions for front-end developers to ask prospective employers.

These questions cover employers who are large enough to have a dedicated development team. It should work reasonably well for both agencies and companies that are working on internal projects.

Interviews usually happen with both Managers and Team Members, so I've split the questions into those two general categories.
